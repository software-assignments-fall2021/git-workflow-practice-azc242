# Git Practice Assignment

1. Link to the article: https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/7-bad-habits-highly-ineffective-software-engineers
2. Although most of this article was reinforcing what I already knew, there was one "bad habit" mentioned that I hadn't considered before. The bah habit that John P. Mello Jr., the author, mentioned is that bad software engineers tend to say "no" to things. He argues that doing so blocks the creative process, and that many software engineers say "no" in fear of trying new things that don't work or will break something that works. In some sense, I agree with what the author is saying, because I am guilty of it at times.

   I feel like the educational system trains people to think of doing the bare minimum to get a working project. It discourages going above and beyond into challenges that may be risky. In the end, however, these habits hinder us as software engineers.
